(MY WEBSITE IS A GROUND UP DESIGN TAKING INSPERATION FROM MULTIPLE OTHER 3D PRINTING SITES, my uncle does tons of 3d printing stuff and i wanted to see what itd be like & what i should do when making him his own website so i used this opportunity as my project!)//

peer reviewed by:Vanessa Acuna - The project looks great, I would just look into aligning text with the last two cards of blog page so that they align. For tablet, center EXPLORE PRODUCT button on the home page and fix the cards so that they align next to each other.
